# recommender_system_KNN

This is an NLP project designed to provide content recommendation based on key words frequency in different chapters of a book 'nursing.pdf'. Each word is represented by a vector of frequencies in the different chapters in the book. An euclidienne distance is being calculated to determine what wods are the most related to a given word.
